### data folder contains two Excel files i.e tagged articles of Fake and Real News

### trained_models: contain all the trained models which we generated in order to utilize it please download the models and save it in `saved` folder.

#### `config.py`: This file has a config variable which would allows us to store the models, make sure that this is changed to `saved` if pretrained_models are being used.

#### `eda.py`: This file generates the exploratory data analysis, of the data and stores it in the `images` folder.

#### `load_file.py`: This file loads the excel file into dataframes

#### `lstm_neural_nets`: This file has code for couple of LSTM models.

#### `main.py`: The main controller file which drives the program

#### `modeling.py`: This file contains the all the code for statistical and linear models

#### `preprocessing.py`: This file is used for preprocessing file.

#### `requirements.txt`: The requirements txt for library dependency
